We have a class where serveral constants are initialized:

[source,java]
./app/src/main/java/intranet/client/network/Constants.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/../complete-android-v1/app/src/main/java/intranet/client/network/Constants.java[]
----

<1> Grails App server url. Please note you may need to change the ip address to match your local machine.
<2> The path we configured in the Grails app in _UrlMappings.groovy_
<3> The version of the API


### Model

The announcements sent by the server are gonna be rendered into this POJO:

[source,java]
./app/src/main/java/intranet/client/network/model/Announcement.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/../complete-android-v1/app/src/main/java/intranet/client/network/model/Announcement.java[]
----

### Networking Dependencies

You will need to add INTERNET permission to _app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml_

[source,xml]
./app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
----
include::{sourcedir}/../complete-android-v1/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml[lines="4"]
----

#### OkHttp

We are going to use one of the most popular http clients for Android, http://square.github.io/okhttp/[OkHttp]

To add OkHttp as a dependency, edit the file _app/build.gradle_ and add, in the
dependencies block, the next line:

[source,groovy]
----
    compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.5.0'
----
#### Gson

https://github.com/google/gson[Gson]:
____

Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON
representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent
Java object.
____

To add Gson as a dependency, edit the file _app/build.gradle_ and add, in the
dependencies block, the next line:

[source,groovy]
----
    compile 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.0'
----

We are going to encapsulte the instantiation of OkHttp Request in a class to ensure the Accept-Version Http header is
always set with the value defined in the _Constants.java_ class

[source,java]
./app/src/main/java/intranet/client/network/NetworkTask.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/../complete-android-v1/app/src/main/java/intranet/client/network/NetworkTask.java[]
----

The next class fetches and returns a list of Announcements.

[source,java]
./app/src/main/java/intranet/client/network/AnnouncementsFetcher.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/../complete-android-v1/app/src/main/java/intranet/client/network/AnnouncementsFetcher.java[]
----

In order to avoid running networking code in the UI thread we are going to encapsulate the networking code in an
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html[AsyncTask]

[source,java]
./app/src/main/java/intranet/client/android/asynctasks/RetrieveAnnouncementsTask.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/../complete-android-v1//app/src/main/java/intranet/client/android/asynctasks/RetrieveAnnouncementsTask.java[]
----

Once we get a list of annocuments ready we will communicate the response to classes implementing the delegate
[source,java]
./app/src/main/java/intranet/client/android/delegates/RetrieveAnnouncementsDelegate.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/../complete-android-v1//app/src/main/java/intranet/client/android/delegates/RetrieveAnnouncementsDelegate.java[]
----

The class which implements the delegate receiving the announcements is the initial Activity

[source,java]
./app/src/main/java/intranet/client/android/activities/MainActivity.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/../complete-android-v1/app/src/main/java/intranet/client/android/activities/MainActivity.java[]
----

<1> Triggers the async tasks to fetch the announcements asynchronously.
<2> Refreshes the UI once we get a list of announcements

MainActivity uses a ListView defined in:

[source,xml]
./app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml
----
include::{sourcedir}/../complete-android-v1/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml[]
----

The next classes and layout files render the different announcements in a ListView and handle the user tap.

[source,java]
./app/src/main/java/intranet/client/android/adapters/AnnouncementAdapter.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/../complete-android-v1//app/src/main/java/intranet/client/android/adapters/AnnouncementAdapter.java[]
----

[source,java]
./app/src/main/java/intranet/client/android/delegates/AnnouncementAdapterDelegate.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/../complete-android-v1//app/src/main/java/intranet/client/android/delegates/AnnouncementAdapterDelegate.java[]
----

[source,xml]
./app/src/main/res/layout/item_announcement.xml
----
include::{sourcedir}/../complete-android-v1/app/src/main/res/layout/item_announcement.xml[]
----
