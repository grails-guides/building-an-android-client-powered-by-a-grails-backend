We want to test the Api version 2.0 does not include the body property when receiving a GET request to the _announcements_
endpoint. The next functional test verifies that behaviour.

```
package intranet.backend

import ...

@Integration
class AnnouncementControllerSpec extends Specification {

    def "test body is present in announcements json payload of Api 1.0"() {
    ....
    }
    
    def "test body is NOT present in announcements json payload of Api 2.0"() {
        given:
        RestBuilder rest = new RestBuilder()

        when: 'Requesting announcements for version 2.0'
        def resp = rest.get("http://localhost:${serverPort}/announcements/") {
            header("Accept-Version", "2.0")
        }

        then: 'the request was successful'
        resp.status == HttpServletResponse.SC_OK

        and: 'the response is a JSON Payload'
        resp.headers.get('Content-Type') == ['application/json;charset=UTF-8']

        and: 'json payload contains an array of annoucements with id, title'
        resp.json.each {
            assert it.id
            assert it.title
            assert !it.body // <2>
        }
    }
    
    def "test detail of an announcement contains body in both version 1.0 and 2.0"() {
    ...
    }
}
```
<2> Body is not present in the JSON paylod
